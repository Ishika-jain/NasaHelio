    description:
      "The making of an aurora is an intricate dance of particles and magnetism between the Sun and Earth. The Sun continuously produces a solar wind, made of charged particles (plasma) carrying the Sunâ€™s magnetic field. As the solar wind nears Earth, it causes the magnetic field of the Earth to be drawn into a giant teardrop shape, squashed on the side closest to the sun and drawn out into a long tail on the side farthest from the sun.",
